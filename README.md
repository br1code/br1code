### Bruno Giovagnoli - @br1code 

Hi! :godmode:  My name is Bruno and I'm a software developer. I like to build things and teach programming.
I believe the best way to learn something is to understand **how it works under the hood**, so that's what I do when it comes to learning and teaching programming.

## My values

:computer: Quality code

:sparkles: Curiosity<br>

:white_check_mark: Willing to make things right<br>

:lock: Safety and trust

## Do you have a job for me?
Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-giovagnoli/), let's chat!

## Wanna learn how to code?
Contact me at brunogiovagnoli@gmail.com. I'd be happy to help you :metal:
