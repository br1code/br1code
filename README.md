### Bruno Giovagnoli - @br1code 

Hi! :godmode:  I'm a software developer. I like to build things and teach programming.
I think the best way to learn something is to understand **how it works under the hood**, so that's what I do when it comes to learning and teaching programming.

## My values
:sparkles: Curiosity<br>

:white_check_mark: Willing to make things right<br>

:lock: Safety and trust

## Goals for 2021
:books: Build a free web platform where I can teach programming<br>

:crying_cat_face: Make enough money to rescue more homeless cats (I already have 6 at home)<br>
